# Tower-Defense-Game

Undead creatures are attacking the city! Position your units to protect the city until you have killed enough of the creatures to drive them off.

In this “tower defence” strategy game, monsters are advancing on the city from right to left across 5 lanes. To kill the monsters, you have to purchase units and place them on the field of battle so that they can shoot or block the monsters. However, you start with 10 gold and only get 1 gold per turn, so spend your precious resources wisely!

There are three types of monsters:
•	Zombies (ZOMBI) start with 15 hit points, deal 3-6 damage and move 1 square each turn. They initially give 2 gold as a reward when killed.
•	Werewolves (WWOLF) start with 10 hit points, deal 1-4 damage and move 2 squares each turn. They initially give 3 gold as a reward when killed.
•	Skeleton (SKELE) start with 20 hit points, deal 1-3 damage and move 1 squares each turn. They initially give 4 gold as a reward when killed.

Players can purchase three types of “defender” units:
•	Archers (ARCHR) start with 5 hit points. Each turn, they will shoot an arrow down their lane from left to right, dealing 1-4 damage to the first monster it hits. They cost 5 gold to purchase.
•	Walls (WALL) start with 20 hit points. They do not deal any damage and serve to block and slow down the monsters. They cost 3 gold to purchase.
•	Cannon (CANON) start with 8 hit points. Each turn, they will shoot down their lane from left to right, dealing 3-5 damage to the first monster it hits. They cost 7 gold to purchase.

Players can play two types of “spells” :
•	Heal (HEAL) adds 5 hit points to all "defender" units within a 3 by 3 area. They cost 5 gold to purchase.
•	Poison (POISON) deducts 5 hit points to all "monster" units within a 3 by 3 area. They cost 5 gold to purchase.

Units purchased by the players can only be placed in the first 3 columns of the field.
Spells purchased by the players can be placed anywhere in the field.
